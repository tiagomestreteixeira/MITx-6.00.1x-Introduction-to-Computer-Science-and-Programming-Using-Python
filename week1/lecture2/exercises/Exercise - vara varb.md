### Exercise: vara varb

        Assume that two variables, varA and varB, are assigned values, either numbers or strings.

        Write a piece of Python code that prints out one of the following messages:

        * "string involved" if either varA or varB are strings

        * "bigger" if varA is larger than varB

        * "equal" if varA is equal to varB

        * "smaller" if varA is smaller than varB
