### Problem 1

        Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

        Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

        Number of vowels: 5


        ### Problem 2

        Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

        Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

        Number of times bob occurs is: 2


        ### Problem 3

        Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

        Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

        Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
        In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

        Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
